This is my personal blog, a place for me to write, to help me learn and to organise my thoughts around topics in Machine Learning Engineering and AI. 


## Work

I currently working working as a Machine Learning Engineer on the Machine Learning Platform team for [Glovo](https://about.glovoapp.com/), a delivery tech company based out of Barcelona, Spain. I've been working to build both an internal Machine Learning Platform and a Feature Store Platform.
