This is my personal blog, a place for me to write, to help me learn and to organise my thoughts around topics in Machine Learning Engineering and AI. 


## Work

I currnetly work on the Machine Learning Platform team for Glovo in Barcelona, Spain. I've been working to build both an internal Machine Learning Platform and a Feature Store Platform.
